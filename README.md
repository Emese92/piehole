Accessible from every page. It has a responsive logo that takes the user back to the main page.

The logos are clear to understand but they also have a descriptive message if hovered over. It has a collapsible navbar on smaller screens.




### Main page:

The main page is accessible to everyone. Users can see recipes, starting with the most popular one on the top and by created date under that. The main page has an infinite scroll so users don't need to click anywhere to get to the next page. It also has a search bar, users can search for ingredients, titles, or usernames. The recipes are card elements that have a big picture, on the bottom is the title of the recipe and on top is the user who created it, which takes the user to the creator's profile page, the save and like options, and the comments link that takes the user to the comments section. likes and comments also have a counter next to them.

If the user is the profile owner, then it has also access to the three dots when clicked. There is a possibility to add a picture, change the username, or change the password.

Add a recipe page has a form to fill in when clicking on the navbar icon. The Edit a recipe page comes with a similar form just prefilled with the previous data. When deleting a recipe users go back to the main page. The edit and delete options are located in the three dots in the Recipe detail view.

There is a bootstrap dark gray navbar on the top of the pages, a light gray background, and a white container on most of the pages. The sign-in and sign-up containers are also dark gray. All pages have some orange highlights popping up.

### Bugs

- After deployment, I realized a bug when an unauthorized user wanted to see a recipe it throw an error. - It has been fixed by adding an extra line of -let isOwner- to the comments.js file.

- I had some misspelling issues - they all should be fixed now.

- The ProfileEditForm.js page was originally together with the UsernameForm.js, it worked with some issues with the username needing to be changed to submit it correctly - Tutor support suggested that I separate them so now they work fine.

- EsLint caused errors that dind't let me deploy my project - I had to delete EsLint and reinstall package.json
